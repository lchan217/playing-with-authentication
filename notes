NEED:
Log out Button
Option for users to login using just email and pw
Bootstrap - will allow to use twitter/google/github icons

User logs in and sees list of their favorite podcasts (Index)
Clicking on each podcast - show details

ISSUES:
- When you log in with google, sometimes provider is showing up as github or twitter
- find a way to catch duplicate users... if they login in first with github, they shouldn't
be allowed to login with google
  - twitter doesn't have an email field, butgithub and google do. hard to prevent this problem if fields
  arent the same
